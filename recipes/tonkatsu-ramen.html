    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons spicy sesame oil</li>
      <li>2 (1x3 inch) boneless pork chop slices</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon black sesame seeds</li>
      <li>2 leaves fresh basil</li>
      <li>1 leaf fresh sage</li>
      <li>1 (3 ounce) package instant ramen noodles</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons shredded dried kombu</li>
      <li>1 3/4 tablespoons bonito soup stock</li>
      <li>1 3/4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon white miso paste with dashi</li>
      <li>1 green onion, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill a small pot halfway with water. Bring to a boil; add egg and cook in boiling water for 15 minutes. Drain. Run cold water over egg and set aside to cool.</li>
      <li>Pour sesame oil into a large skillet. Lay pork slices in oil. Cover pork with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, 1/2 of the basil, and 1/2 of the sage. Flip and cover pork with these remaining ingredients.</li>
      <li>Cook pork, covered, over medium-low heat, until evenly browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until second side is browned, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat.</li>
      <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook ramen noodles in boiling water until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander set in the sink; rinse noodles until water runs clear. Return noodles to the pot.</li>
      <li>Stir kombu, bonito stock, soy sauce, and miso paste into noodles. Cook, stirring with chopsticks, over medium heat, until miso paste is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer noodles to a serving bowl.</li>
      <li>Peel and cut egg in half lengthwise. Place egg, pork slices, and fish paste slices over noodles. Garnish with tonkatsu sauce, ginger, green onion, and black pepper.</li>
